## Usage Notes
- This notebook simulates the full pre-image generation creative pipeline:
  - TrendAgent: suggests trending aesthetics
  - PromptAgent: generates structured prompts
  - AestheticAgent: scores and ranks prompts
  - PublisherAgent: builds social-ready content bundles
- All logic is offline and deterministic (with small randomness for trends).
- If you already created `tools/` and `memory/` modules in the repo, the notebook will import them. Otherwise it uses safe fallbacks embedded above.
